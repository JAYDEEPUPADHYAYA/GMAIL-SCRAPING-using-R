# WEB SCRAPING

## What is Web Scraping ?

Web Scraping is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format.

## Why use Web Scraping?

Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. There is no other way to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option we are left with is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.
