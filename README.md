# WEB SCRAPING

## What is Web Scraping ?

Web Scraping is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format.

## Why use Web Scraping?

Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. There is no other way to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option we are left with is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time. 

## Static Scraping vs. Dynamic Scraping-
Static scraping ignores JavaScript. It fetches web pages from the server without the help of a browser. You get exactly what you see in “view page source”, and then you slice and dice it. If the content you’re looking for is available, you need to go no further. However, if the content is something like an `iframe`, you need dynamic scraping.

Dynamic scraping uses an actual browser (or a headless browser) and lets JavaScript do its thing. Then, it queries the DOM to extract the content it’s looking for. Sometimes you need to automate the browser by simulating a user to get the content you need. In order for me to get the same details for the remaining posts, i would need to first navigate to the next page, which involves clicking the Next button at the bottom of the search results page.
